# section.nvim

** Work in Progress **

Personally, I really like to use comments to section my code a little bit, as it helps me
keep a better overview of the code. Creating these comments can be quite cumbersome at times,
so why not try my hand at creating a small NeoVim plugins that takes care of exactly that.

This plugin is really not anywhere close the being finished, so I will skip providing any
installation and setup instructions... but feel free to send any feedback, tips or tricks my way ðŸ˜„
